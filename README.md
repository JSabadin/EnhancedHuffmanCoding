# Huffman Coding Project

## Overview
This project implements Huffman coding in Python, a well-known algorithm for data compression. It uniquely applies Huffman coding to a binary file and subsequently to the list of code substitutions generated from this initial coding. The project also explores the efficiency of Huffman coding on tuples of varying lengths (1, 2, 3, and 4).

## Features
- **Huffman Coding of Binary Files:** Enables compression of binary files using Huffman coding.
- **Recursive Huffman Coding:** Applies Huffman coding on the list of code substitutions from the initial Huffman coding process.
- **Tuple Length Variation:** Investigates the compression efficiency of Huffman coding on tuples of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- **Python Implementation:** Fully implemented in Python for ease of use and adaptability.
